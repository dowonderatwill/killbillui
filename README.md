A Simple UI for KillBill backend
The KAUI provided by KillBill was not suiting me for the quick demo and usage while doing some feature testing of KillBill backend, hence created this simple UI.

To start this application
   - mvnw spring-boot:run  
   - To check whether it is running properly enter http://localhost:<port>/home in the browser and it should show admin.html as controlled in MainController.java
